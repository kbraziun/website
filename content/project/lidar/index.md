Managers of forested landscapes are at the forefront of adapting to fire regimes in western forests that are expected to change dramatically in the coming century, and detailed information on fuel distribution is critical for predicting fire behavior and planning effective fuels treatments. To address this need, this research project has two primary objectives: 

1. To assess the capability of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to characterize spatial and vertical distribution of canopy, understory, and coarse woody fuels in the Northern Rocky Mountains, and 
2. To test the feasibility of transforming LiDAR-derived canopy and fuels data into a format compatible with fire modeling software used by fire managers in Grand Teton National Park (GRTE). 

This research will capitalize on existing LiDAR data that were collected for all of GRTE in 2014 along with fuels data collected during GRTEâ€™s vegetation mapping effort in the early 2000s. Fuel loads and forest structure will be derived from LiDAR following published methods, and accuracy will be assessed using existing and new field validation data (summer 2019 data collection). A fuels map and associated outputs (e.g., canopy cover, canopy height) will be developed in collaboration with and tailored to the needs of GRTE land and fire managers. Data on forest structure and fuels can also inform other management applications (e.g., wildlife habitat assessment) and future research (e.g., severity of short-return-interval fires).
